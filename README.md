<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

[![P-FER Assistant][product-screenshot]](https://github.com/RodolfoFerro/psychopathology-fer-assistant)

An intelligent assistant to track psychopathology patients responses during face-to-face and remote sessions.

### Motivation

Mental health is important. I will be adding a more detailed paragraph here, with references and everything.

### Built With

With a lot of love üíñ, motivation to help others üí™üèº and [Python](https://www.python.org/) üêç, using:

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running follow these simple steps.

### Prerequisites

This is an example of how to list things you need to use the software and how to install them. For this particular section I will suppose that you already have git installed on your system.

For a general everview of the Raspberry Pi setup, you can check out my blog tutorial on [how to setup your Raspberry Pi Model B as Google Colab (Feb '19) to work with Tensorflow, Keras and OpenCV](https://rodolfoferro.xyz/Setup-your-Raspberry-Pi-as-Google-Colab/), **as those are the steps that we will follow**. In any case, this specific setup can be seen in the corresponding [rpi](https://github.com/RodolfoFerro/psychopathology-fer-assistant/tree/master/rpi) folder.

### Installation

1. Clone the `psychopathology-fer-assistant` repo:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/RodolfoFerro/psychopathology-fer-assistant.git
```
2. Create a virtual environment with Python 3.7. (For this step I will assume that you are able to create a virtual environment with `virtualenv` or `conda`, but in any case you can check [Real Python's post about virtual environments](https://realpython.com/python-virtual-environments-a-primer/).)
3. Install requirements using `pip`:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Run the dashboard

To run the dashboard you will need to get access to the MongoDB cluster by setting the `MONGO_URI` variable in the corresponding `db` file. Once you have done this and have installed the requirements, get the dashboard up and running with:
```bash
python run.py
```

<!-- USAGE EXAMPLES -->
## Usage

### Data Exploration

The dataset used for this project is the one published in the "[Challenges in Representation Learning: Facial Expression Recognition Challenge](https://www.kaggle.com/c/challenges-in-representation-learning-facial-expression-recognition-challenge/data)" by Kaggle. This dataset has been used to train a custom model built with Tensorflow 2.0.

The data consists of 48x48 pixel grayscale images of faces. The faces have been automatically registered so that the face is more or less centered and occupies about the same amount of space in each image. The task is to categorize each face based on the emotion shown in the facial expression in to one of seven categories (0=Angry, 1=Disgust, 2=Fear, 3=Happy, 4=Sad, 5=Surprise, 6=Neutral). A sample of the dataset can be seen in the next image.

If you would like to see the data exploration process, checkout the notebook found in the [data folder](https://github.com/RodolfoFerro/psychopathology-fer-assistant/tree/master/data), or click on the following button to open it directly into Google Colab.

### Model Training

After doing some research in the state of the art for Facial Expression Recognition tasks, I found that in "[Extended deep neural network for facial emotion recognition (EDNN)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S016786551930008X)" by Deepak Kumar Jaina, Pourya Shamsolmoalib, and Paramjit Sehdev (Elsevier ‚Äì¬†Pattern Recognition Letters 2019) the proposed model turns out to achieve better results in classification tasks for Facial Expression Recognition, and by the architecture metrics this network turns out to be a more lightweight model compared with others (such as LeNet or Mobile Net).

As part of the project development **I have implemented from zero the proposed model using Tensorflow 2.0**. For training I used the previously mentioned dataset from the "[Challenges in Representation Learning: Facial Expression Recognition Challenge](https://www.kaggle.com/c/challenges-in-representation-learning-facial-expression-recognition-challenge/data)" by Kaggle. So far the model was trained **for only 10 epochs using a batch size of 132**. The training history can be seen in the following graphs:

<center>
<img src="assets/10_128_loss.png" width="40%">
<img src="assets/10_128_acc.png" width="40%">
</center>

About the results, **the model has achieved an accuracy value of 0.4428 on the validation dataset with only 10 training epochs**, with a result that could be part of the top 40 scores in the [challenge leaderboard](https://www.kaggle.com/c/challenges-in-representation-learning-facial-expression-recognition-challenge/leaderboard). We can get a general idea of the model performance in the confussion matrix:

</center>

The trained model architecture and quantized model with tflite (for the deployment in the Raspberry Pi) can be found in the [model folder](https://github.com/RodolfoFerro/psychopathology-fer-assistant/tree/master/model). Finally, if you want to re-train the model and verify the results by your own, or only if you have the curiosity to understand deeper the whole process of building and training the model with detail, checkout the notebook found in the same folder, or click on the following button to open it directly into Google Colab.
